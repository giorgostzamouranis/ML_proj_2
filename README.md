# Machine Learning Lab Project - Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques on hyperspectral and remote sensing image data. The methodologies applied include:

- **K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means Clustering**
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for Dimensionality Reduction**
- **Feature Extraction using Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The project utilizes hyperspectral image data and remote sensing data. The preprocessing involves:

- Loading image datasets
- Visualizing different spectral channels
- Applying clustering methods to segment and analyze images

## ðŸš€ Implementation
The main steps involved in this project are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading and visualizing hyperspectral image data.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using **PCA** to reduce the number of spectral bands.
3. **Clustering**: Applying **K-Means** and **Fuzzy C-Means** on processed data.
4. **Feature Extraction**: Using **CNN-based feature extraction** for improved clustering results.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Comparing clustering results with pixel-based approaches.
